## Starting with SAFE Stack

Recently I've finally dug a bit deeper into the SAFE stack.  
One of the most exciting resources to start with full-stack F# applications was [SAFE Dojo](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/SAFE-Dojo).

It doesn't require a lot of preparation. Just install .Net Core SDK version 5 or higher, and you are ready to go!

You can find my solution on [github](https://github.com/jciechowski/SAFE-Dojo/commit/0a6024237200c6816d9c1ccbaea22ec37b01e48f).
But before reading it, I encourage you to try it by yourself.
It's enjoyable!

Stay tuned for more posts about applications written using the SAFE stack.
